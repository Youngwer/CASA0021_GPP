<img align="left" width="300" src="./Images/book1.png" alt="Product demo of LitMate" style="margin-right: 30px"/>

**Key Features:**
- Physical book light with open/close mechanism showing reading status
- Visual Pomodoro timer through page angle movement
- LED indicators showing reading progress for yourself and your reading partner
- Touch sensor for interaction and color changes
- Companion mobile app for tracking reading statistics and connecting with other readers
- WiFi connectivity with easy setup through Access Point mode
- MQTT protocol for real-time status synchronization between paired devices

## üåü Why the Project is Useful

LitMate addresses the challenge many readers face: difficulty in maintaining consistent reading habits. According to a 2019 Harris Poll, 81% of U.S. adults report not reading as much as they wish due to limited time. Research on the "false hope syndrome" explains this pattern of repeated failure and renewed intention (Polivy & Herman, 2002).

LitMate transforms reading from a solitary activity into a shared experience by:
1. **Creating accountability** through paired devices that show when your partner is reading
2. **Visualizing progress** with physical and light indicators
3. **Building routine** through Pomodoro timing techniques
4. **Fostering community** via the companion app's social features
5. **Reducing distractions** by making reading time visible and meaningful

## üîß Technical Details

### System Architecture

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="./Images/arch.png" alt="System Architecture">
</div>

When significant state changes occur (book opening/closing, touch interaction, light color change), the device immediately publishes updates to the appropriate topics. The MQTT client maintains persistent connections with automatic reconnection mechanisms to ensure connected devices receive the latest state information.

Therefore, this lightweight communication framework enables the paired LitMate devices to maintain synchronized state and respond to each other's actions in real-time within seconds.

### 4.3 Core Reading Functionality
The core of LitMate's functionality revolves around its ability to physically interact with books, track reading sessions, and provide visual feedback through an integrated system of hardware control and state management.

#### 4.3.1 Pomodoro Timer 
The LitMate device incorporates a sophisticated Pomodoro timer that combines time tracking with physical visualization through servo motor positioning.

The Pomodoro functions are tightly integrated with the book state management system: When book is open, it start working, set an hour Pomodoro timer; When the full one-hour session completes, it triggers the book closure mechanism.

##### Servo Angle as Visual Progress Indicator
Another feature of LitMate's Pomodoro is the use of servo angle position as a physical progress indicator. As reading time advances, the servo motors adjust their position in 15-degree increments:

```cpp
if (currentStage != lastServoStage) {
        // Calculate new servo position: starting from 180 degrees, decreasing by 15 degrees per stage
        int targetPosition = 180 - (currentStage * DEGREES_PER_STAGE);
        
        // Smoothly move to the new position
        moveServosSmooth(180 - (lastServoStage * DEGREES_PER_STAGE), 
                          targetPosition, 
                          (lastServoStage < currentStage) ? 5 : -5, 
                          50);
        
        lastServoStage = currentStage;
    }

```

#### 4.3.2 Button Interaction Logic (Short Press vs. Long Press)
The system uses a single button interface with differentiated press durations to control multiple functions. The button handler utilise debouncing and timing mechanisms to distinguish between short and long presses:
- **Short Press**: Toggles the progress indicator LEDs on/off.
- **Long Press (for more than 3 seconds)**: Toggles the book's open/closed state.

```cpp
// Function to check button status
void checkButton() {
    // Read button state (LOW means pressed)
    int buttonState = digitalRead(BUTTON_PIN);
    
    // Button pressed
    if (buttonState == LOW && !buttonPressed) {
        buttonPressed = true;
        buttonPressTime = millis();
        longPressTriggered = false;
    } 
    
    // Button held down, check if long press duration is reached
    else if (buttonState == LOW && buttonPressed) {
        unsigned long pressDuration = millis() - buttonPressTime;
        
        // Long press duration reached and long press action not yet triggered
        if (pressDuration >= LONG_PRESS_TIME && !longPressTriggered) {
            toggleBook();         // Toggle the book's open/close status
            longPressTriggered = true;
            Serial.println("Long press detected, toggling book status");
        }
    }
    // Button released
    else if (buttonState == HIGH && buttonPressed) {
        unsigned long pressDuration = millis() - buttonPressTime;
        buttonPressed = false;
        
        // Short press - control LED lights
        if (pressDuration < LONG_PRESS_TIME && !longPressTriggered) {
            toggleLEDs();
            Serial.println("Short press detected, toggling LED status");
        }
        longPressTriggered = false;
    }
}
```

#### 4.3.3 Session-based and Cumulative Time Tracking
The system can distinguish between active reading sessions and cumulative daily reading time. When the book is opened, a new reading session begins. The system uses the millis() function to track time and records the start time and begins tracking the session duration. When the book is closed, the session duration is calculated and added to the cumulative daily reading time. This approach allows the system to maintain accurate time records even through multiple reading sessions throughout the day. The related code is shown below:
```cpp
// Start reading timer
void startReadingTimer() {
    startTime = millis();
    lastUpdateTime = startTime;
    Serial.println("Reading session started!");
    
    // Publish reading status to MQTT
    publishReadingStatus(true, dailyReadingTime);
}
// Stop reading timer
void stopReadingTimer() {
    if (startTime > 0) {
        unsigned long sessionTime = millis() - startTime;
        dailyReadingTime += sessionTime;
        Serial.print("Reading session ended. Session time: ");
        printTime(sessionTime);
        Serial.print("Total daily reading time: ");
        printTime(dailyReadingTime);
        
        // Publish reading status to MQTT
        publishReadingStatus(false, dailyReadingTime);
        
        startTime = 0;
    }
}
```

#### 4.3.4 Daily Reading Reset Mechanism
When a new day begins, the system logs the previous day's total reading time, resets the counter, and publishes the updated state to the MQTT network to ensure paired devices are synchronized.



### 4.4 User Interaction and Data Visualisation

#### 4.4.1 LED Indication System

##### Book Lamp
The main book lamp serves as both a reading light and a status indicator, using color and animation effects to visualise the device's state.

When both books are open, the Book Lamp will display a smooth "breathing" effect that provides ambient lighting, which enhances the reading experience across both users, creating a reading atmosphere.

```cpp
void updateBreathingEffect() {
    unsigned long currentTime = millis();
    if (currentTime - lastBreathTime >= BREATH_INTERVAL) {
        if (increasing) {
            brightness += 5;
            if (brightness >= 255) {
                brightness = 255;
                increasing = false;
            }
        } else {
            brightness -= 5;
            if (brightness <= 0) {
                brightness = 0;
                increasing = true;
            }
        }
	lastBreathTime = currentTime;
}
```
The book lamp color can be changed between pink (default) and yellow through the vibration sensor double-tap detection, which is design for interactive purposes to increase fun through readers:
```cpp
if (tapInterval > minTapInterval && tapInterval < doubleTapWindow) {
    // Toggle light color and publish
    isYellowColor = !isYellowColor;
    publishLightColor(isYellowColor);
    
    // Apply the new color to LEDs
    if (isYellowColor) {
        setLEDColor(255, 255, 0);  // Yellow
    } else {
        setLEDColor(255, 102, 178);  // Pink
    }
}

```
This color change is synchronized between paired devices, creating a shared visual experience between remote users.




#### 4.4.2 Progress Indicator LEDs

The system implements separate LED strips for each user, which can be identified by color, to visualise reading time for both the user's device and the paired device. The number of LED display logic is shown in code below:
```cpp
// Map reading time to LED display (8 LEDs represent progress thresholds)
    int ledsToLight = 0;
    if (totalSeconds < 450) {
        ledsToLight = 1;
    } else if (totalSeconds < 900) {
        ledsToLight = 2;
    } else if (totalSeconds < 1350) {
        ledsToLight = 3;
    } else if (totalSeconds < 1800) {
        ledsToLight = 4;
    } else if (totalSeconds < 2250) {
        ledsToLight = 5;
    } else if (totalSeconds < 2700) {
        ledsToLight = 6;
    } else if (totalSeconds < 3150) {
        ledsToLight = 7;
    } else {
        ledsToLight = 8;
    }
```

Also, these reading progress LEDs can be switched on and off via a short button press to conserve power, which is shown below:
```cpp
    if (!progressLEDsEnabled) {
        // Turn off both progress bar LEDs
        timeStrip.clear();
        timeStrip.show();
        
        deviceBTimeStrip.clear();
        deviceBTimeStrip.show();
    } else {
        // Re-enable progress bar LEDs
        updateTimeLEDs();
        updateDeviceBTimeLEDs();
    }
```

    <p><em>Fig 32. Future Design Possibilities</em></p>
</div>
Some of the advice about the product gained during the pitch made the team rethink about product design.

- **Size**: The team tends to reduce the size of the product in the next iteration by upgrading the hardware to make it more write and easy to use. In fact, the current product still has a lot of free space inside.
- **Visualisation**: For visualisation, the team preferred to make another prototype where the pages of the book could be opened from each side to represent the reading progress of both sides for a more intuitive comparison.

### 6.2 How to Improve Hardware of LitMate?
#### 6.2.1 Circuit Assembly and Challenges
The circuit was designed to be straightforward, focusing on ease of connection. However, the symmetrical layout made wiring more complex, leading to issues in organization and debugging. The key challenges faced during assembly were:
- **Complex Wiring Layout**: The symmetrical arrangement of components made routing difficult, increasing the risk of loose connections.
- **Power Supply Limitations**: The initial single power source was insufficient for stable operation, especially when driving multiple LEDs and servos.
- **Vibration Sensor Sensitivity**: The SW420 sensor was difficult to fine-tune, sometimes failing to detect subtle touches or triggering false readings.

To address these issues, some measures were taken :
1) Simplified the routing layout, reducing unnecessary wiring complexity.
2) Implemented a separate power supply, ensuring adequate power distribution.
3) Adjusted the sensitivity threshold of the SW420 sensor to improve its reliability.

#### 6.2.2 PCB Design
For the purpose of simplifying the hardware assembly of the product as well as reducing the size of the product. Designing a dedicated PCB is an ideal ending solution and the team has made the following attempts so far:

    <img src="./PCB Design/PCB.png" alt="PCB Design" style="width: 80%;">
    <p><em>Fig 33. PCB Design</em></p>
</div>

### 6.3 Application

The current APP is limited to Android mobile phones and has not yet been linked to a physical book light, which could be developed in both directions in future developments and iterations: 
1) Develop different versions of the app for Android and IOS phones; 
2) Implement a digital twin between mobile application and physical book light, allowing users to control the book light on/off and synchronise the reading time recorded by the book light in the application.

### 6.4 MarketisationÔºöInability to finally recognise costs
Below are the current individual equipment costingÔºö

| Component | Quantity | Subtotal (GBP) | Estimated Cost (GBP) | Notes |

| Servo Motor | 2 | ¬£3.3-¬£5.5 | ¬£4.4 | Controls book opening/closing |
| WS2812B LED Strip | 4 segments (8 LEDs each) | ¬£8.8-¬£13.2 | ¬£11.0 | For status display |
| Push Button | 1 | ¬£0.22-¬£0.55 | ¬£0.4 | Stainless steel button |
| 4xAA Battery Holder | 1 | ¬£0.55-¬£1.1 | ¬£0.8 | 6V power supply |
| Acrylic Enclosure | - | ¬£5.5-¬£11 | ¬£8.3 | Including laser cutting cost |
| Other Components (Wires, Resistors, etc.) | - | ¬£2.2-¬£3.3 | ¬£2.8 | Basic electronic components |
| **Total** | - | **¬£26.6-¬£44.5** | **¬£35.7** | - |


The ultimate goal of the product is to sell it on kickstater, so the cost and selling price need to be considered, but there are two uncertainties at the moment: the **paper-folding work** needs to seek cooperation from manufacturers for mass production, and the **subsequent development and maintenance costs of the APP**.
