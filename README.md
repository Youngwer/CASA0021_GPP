### 1.2 Background
In today's fast-paced life, many people struggle to balance reading and work. Traditional reading lights lack the ability to connect readers and create a shared reading experience. We believe that reading should not be a solitary activity - it can be more engaging and motivating when shared with others.ÔºàË°•ÂÖÖÁÆÄÂçïÁöÑ‰∫åÊâãË∞ÉÁ†îÔºâ

### 1.3 Motivation
Our team aims to bridge reading friends through interactive features like tap gestures and reading progress sharing. By establishing a mechanism of mutual supervision and encouragement among reading partners, we hope to create a community with a vibrant reading atmosphere where one can easily find reading partners and stay motivated in their reading journey.ÔºàÁõÆÊ†á‰∫∫Áæ§Ôºâ
